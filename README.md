# PRODIGY_SD_03
This project demonstrates a practical desktop application built with object-oriented Java and Swing UI. It’s ideal for learning event-driven programming, GUI layout, file I/O, and simple data persistence. The app stores contacts (name, phone, email) in memory and saves them to a CSV file for persistence between sessions.
